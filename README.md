# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ismail Anegdouil

I'm a student with a growing passion for coding — especially in **C#** and **web development**.  
At school, I’ve had the chance to build different apps and websites, which helped me learn a lot by doing.  

🌱 Right now, I’m focused on getting better at full-stack development.  
🤝 Always happy to connect or collaborate on fun and meaningful projects.  
📫 You can reach me here on GitHub — feel free to say hi!  
😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new tech and finding creative ways to solve problems.
